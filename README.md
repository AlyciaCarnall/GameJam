# GameJam
For one of our modules in uni, we were tasked to create a coin-up arcade game and to re-imagine it using modern technology. 
The game we have chosen is Ice Climbers.

For this module our game must be designed to incorporate coin operation with the gameplay being designed to suit an arcade setting.

In our group we have 8 people:

KieranJFrank is our Project Manager.
Rhobertt is our Scrum Master.
GuyOfPandora is our Lead Designer.
Kittyjelly19 and AlyciaCarnall are our Lead Programmers.
TotallyPorff is one of our programmers.
T7090979 is one of our programmers.
rolalzebub is one of our programmers and designer.
